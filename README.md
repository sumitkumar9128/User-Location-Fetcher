# User Live Location Fetcher

This project is a simple JavaScript-based web application I created to explore how browser APIs work. It uses the Geolocation API to get the user's real-time location (latitude, longitude) and accuracy, and displays additional information like the device's platform and browser details.



## Features

- Real-Time Location Fetching: Learn how to access and use the browser's Geolocation API to retrieve user location data.

- Reverse Geocoding: Converts the coordinates into a readable address using the OpenStreetMap API.

- Device Information Display: Shows platform and browser details to understand how user agent information can be accessed.


## Project Purpose

This project was primarily created to see how APIs can be used to interact with browser functionalities and improve user experience. Feel free to check out the code and try it out. Happy Coding
